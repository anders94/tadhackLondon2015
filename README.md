# Tadhack London 2015 - The Matrix Bot

![Matrix Bot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2127160/matrix-bot-2.jpg)
This is an experimental project by Anders Brownworth and Scott Barstow to demonstrate the use of Matrix.org's platform with an IoT device.

In the demonstration app, we have enabled a Raspberry Pi to drive a robot using WebRTC and live streaming of video from a Janus Gateway on the device.

## Software Components

The [Matrix Listener](matrixListener), which subscribes to a room in matrix and listens to all events for the room

The App Server, which has a simple browser that streams the video and provides basic controls for the device.



The app itself is written in NodeJS for all components.
